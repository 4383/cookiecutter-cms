# Cookiecutter for Computational Chemistry Python Packages

An [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for those interested in developing computational 
chemistry packages in Python. Skeletal starting repositories can be created from this template to create the 
file structure semi-autonomously so you can focus on what's important: the science!

## Requirements

* Python 2.7, 3.5, or 3.6
* [Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
